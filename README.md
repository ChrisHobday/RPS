# RPS
Simple Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell

## Stack
This project uses [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Info
I am creating this simple version of Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell for learning purposes.

### Things I Expect To Learn
1) Basic Haskell usage
2) Timers (via 3,2,1 countdown)
3) Randomness (via basic AI sign choice)
4) Async (via concurrent AI and Player sign selection)
5) Server/Client (via 2 player networking)
