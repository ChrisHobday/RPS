Simple Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell

## Stack
This project uses [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Info
I am creating this simple version of Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell for learning purposes.

### Things I Expect To Learn
1) [x] Basic Haskell usage
2) [x] Timers (via 3,2,1 countdown). Implemented threadDelay from Control.Concurrent
3) [x] Randomness (via basic AI sign choice). Implemented randomRIO from System.Random
4) [x] Async (via concurrent AI and Player sign selection). Implemented mVars, tVars and tMVars from Control.Concurrent/Control.Concurrent.STM in their own branches
5) [ ] Server/Client (via 2 player networking)
