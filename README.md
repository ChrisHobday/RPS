# RPS
Simple Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell

## Stack
This project uses [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Info
I am creating this simple version of Rock Paper Scissors in Haskell for learning purposes.

### Things I Expect To Learn
Basic Haskell usage
Timers (via 3,2,1 countdown)
Randomness (via basic AI sign choice)
Async (via concurrent AI and Player sign selection)
Server/Client (via 2 player networking)
